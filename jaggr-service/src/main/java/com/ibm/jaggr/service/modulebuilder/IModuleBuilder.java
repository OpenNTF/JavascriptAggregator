/**
 * This interface is implemented by module builders.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are created by the eclipse extension framework
 * for Aggregator extensions that implement the
 * {@code com.ibm.jaggr.service.modulebuilder} extension point.
 * Aggregator extensions may also register module builders by calling
 * {@link IExtensionRegistrar#registerExtension} when the extension's
 * {@link IExtensionInitializer#initialize} method is called (assuming the
 * extension implements the {@link IExtensionInitializer} interface).
 * <p>
 * The extension point defines the {@code plugin} and {@code extension}
 * attributes which are used by the aggregator to select the extension
 * implementation based on the module being built. See
 * {@link IAggregator#getModuleBuilder} for a description of how the aggregator
 * selects an {@code IMoudleBuilder} for a module.
 * <p>
 * Module builders provide the processed and minified (built) content for the
 * type of module being requested. The built output may vary depending on
 * request parameters. In this case, implementors need to provide a
 * {@link ICacheKeyGenerator} which will be used to obtain a unique identifier
 * for a build with the given request parameters. The keys from this object will
 * be used by the module cache manager to locate cached builds that can satisfy
 * the current request, and by the layer cache manager to identify cached
 * layers.
 * <p>
 * Module builds are provided as javascript code that defines an AMD module. For
 * non-javascript types of content, the content must be provided as a javascript
 * string wrapped in a define function similar to the following:
 * <p>
 * <code>define([], 'Content goes here');</code>
 * <p>
 * The above example is for an anonymous module. If the request attribute
 * specified by {@link IHttpTransport#EXPORTMODULENAMES_REQATTRNAME} is true,
 * then a named module must be provided with the module name specified as the
 * first parameter of the define function.
 * <p>
 * <code>define("foo/bar", [], 'Content goes here');</code>
 * <p>
 * It is assumed that there is a loader plugin on the client that requested the
 * module which knows how to extract the content from the module and work with
 * it, or transform it if necessary. For many non-javascript resources, the text
 * plugin provided by the {@link IHttpTransport} extension can be relied upon to
 * handle the content on the client.
 * <p>
 * Each of the methods in this interface can be called concurrently for the same
 * or different requests, so implementors must take appropriate steps to guard
 * against race conditions and other threading issues common in multi-threaded
 * programs. In particular, module builders must not set request attributes
 * directly since this operation is not thread-safe. Instead, module builders
 * may set properties in the ConcurrentMap which may be retrieved from the
 * request attribute named {@link IAggregator#CONCURRENTMAP_REQATTRNAME}.
 */
public interface IModuleBuilder {

	/**
	 * Returns a {@link ModuleBuild} object containing the processed (built)
	 * output for the requested module.
	 * <p>
	 * If an error occurs, this method can throw an exception, or else let an
	 * exception that occurs at a lower level propagate up. How the exception
	 * gets handled depends largely on whether or not development mode is
	 * enabled.
	 * <p>
	 * If development mode is not enabled, then the exception is converted to a
	 * ServletException and allowed to propagate to the servlet container. This
	 * will result in an error response being returned to the client.
	 * <p>
	 * If development mode is enabled, then exceptions thrown by this method are
	 * handled by creating a module build containing code to invoke
	 * console.error() on the client, specifying the exception message as the
	 * error text, and the aggregated response is flagged as an error response
	 * to prevent caching of the response either on the server or on the client.
	 * The content value which is returned by the define function is an empty
	 * string.
	 * <p>
	 * If a builder would like to handle errors in development mode differently,
	 * either by providing partial content or to have more control over what is
	 * displayed in the client console, then this method can return the error
	 * content in the build output and use the {@link ModuleBuild} constructor
	 * that allows you to specify an error flag. Specifying true for the error
	 * flag will cause the aggregated response containing this module build to
	 * be flagged as an error and the build output will not be cached either on
	 * the server or on the client.
	 * <p>
	 * If the request attribute specified by
	 * {@link IHttpTransport#EXPORTMODULENAMES_REQATTRNAME} is false, then this
	 * method SHOULD return an anonymous module, however, if the request
	 * attribute is true, then this method MUST return a named module (the first
	 * parameter of the define function for the module must be the value
	 * specified by {@code mid}).
	 * <p>
	 * If, for some reason, a module builder is unable to provide named modules
	 * for a request, then the module builder should register a
	 * {@link IRequestListener} service with the OSGi service registry,
	 * specifying the name of the aggregator as the {@code name} property of the
	 * service, and then set the value of the
	 * {@link IHttpTransport#EXPORTMODULENAMES_REQATTRNAME} request attribute to
	 * false in the {@link IRequestListener#startRequest} method.
	 * <p>
	 * This method may choose to return a build containing multiple named
	 * modules if the request attribute specified by
	 * {@link IHttpTransport#EXPORTMODULENAMES_REQATTRNAME} is true. A builder
	 * that provides i18n resource modules, for example, may choose to include
	 * additional, locale specific, resource modules based on the request
	 * locale(s), however, this may only be done if all the modules in a
	 * response are named. If anonymous modules are being requested (i.e. the
	 * request attribute specified by
	 * {@link IHttpTransport#EXPORTMODULENAMES_REQATTRNAME} is false), then only
	 * the requested module may be included in the build output, regardless of
	 * whether or not the module builds provided by this builder are named.
	 * <p>
	 * The module builder may update one or more of the cache key generators in
	 * <code>keyGens</code> by specifying a new list of cache key generators in
	 * the returned {@link ModuleBuild} object. When a new list is provided,
	 * the cached cache key generator list for this module, and any layers
	 * containing this module, are updated. If this method returns the same list
	 * object specified by <code>keyGens</code> in the {@link ModuleBuild}
	 * , then no updates of the cached key generators are performed. Most module
	 * builders will have no need to update a cached key generator list once it
	 * has been created and should just return 
	 * <code>keyGens</code> in the {@link ModuleBuild} object, however, if 
	 * <code>keyGens</code> is null,
	 * then a new cache key generator list containing only non-provisional 
	 * cache key generators MUST be provided in the returned {@link ModuleBuild}.
	 * <p>
	 * A module builder should always return the same sized cache key generator
	 * list for any given resource, and the cache key generators in the list
	 * must be the same class, and in the same sequence, for all responses for
	 * the same resource. Note that subclasses of this class may add their own
	 * cache key generators to the result list, so <code>keyGens</code> may be
	 * larger than what this method previously returned because it contains
	 * contributions from the subclasses. If this class wishes to update the
	 * cache key generator list, it should not try to include any of these
	 * added cache key generators in the new list. It should only include its
	 * own cache key generators. Subclasses are responsible for detecting that
	 * the superclass has updated the list in the result and then adding their
	 * own cache key generators to the new result.
