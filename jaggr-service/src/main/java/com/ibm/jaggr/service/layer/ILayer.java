 * A layer is an aggregation of modules. An ILayer object organizes a collection
 * of layer builds, where each layer build is an aggregation of module builds
 * for the same modules, with the layer builds varying according to the features
 * specified in the request and other request parameters.
 * <p>
 * Collections of ILayer objects and {@link IModule} objects together constitute
 * the cache metadata encapsulated by an {@link ICache} object. Instances of
 * this object are serialized, through serialization of the containing
 * {@link ICache} object, by the cache manager when it periodically saves a
 * snapshot of the cache metadata to disk. Serialization is actually performed
 * on clones of the objects in the cache in order to avoid performance
 * degradation which would be caused by locking of critical sections during file
 * I/O.
 * <p>
 * Instances of ILayer are cloneable and serializable.
