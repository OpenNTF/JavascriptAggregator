/**
 * This interface defines property names for standard aggregator options
 * properties. It also provides convenience getters for those properties.
 * <p>
 * The options are backed by a {@link Properties} object, so any property,
 * including properties not defined by this interface, can be read using
 * {@link #getOption(String)} and set using
 * {@link #setOption(String, String)}.
 * <p>
 * The options are read on bundle activation from aggregator.properties located
 * in the home directory of the user that started the server.
 * <p>
 * Aggregator options are server-wide, meaning the each aggregator servlet
 * running on a given server shares the same options. A single OSGi service is
 * registered using the IOptions interface during bundle activation for the
 * aggregator bundle. Calls to {@link IAggregator#getOptions()} return this
 * single instance of the options object.
