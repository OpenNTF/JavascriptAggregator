/**
 * Instances of CacheKeyGenerator are used to create request specific cache keys
 * for modules. These keys are used to select previously generated and cached
 * builds to satisfy subsequent requests for the same module which yield
 * identical keys.
 * <p>
 * Like Strings, CacheKeyGenerators are immutable. A cache key generator must
 * contain sufficient information within its instance data to be able to
 * generate a cache key for a request without referring to the module that the
 * generator is associated with. Because cache key generators are immutable,
 * they must not be affected by changes to the originating module source.
 * <p>
 * The requirement that CacheKeyGenerators be immutable allows cloneable objects
 * like layers and modules, which maintain references to cache key generators,
 * to clone the CacheKeyGenerators by reference, and so instances of
 * CacheKeyGenerator do not, themselves, need to be cloneable.
 * <p>
 * A layer is identified by the collection of modules that it aggregates. Each
 * layer manages a cache of layer builds, were each layer build aggregates a
 * collection of module builds that were built with different request
 * attributes. Associated with each layer is a map of CacheKeyGenerators where
 * the map key is a CacheKeyGeneator class name and the map value is a
 * CacheKeyGenerator object that was created by calling
 * {@link ICacheKeyGenerator#combine(ICacheKeyGenerator)} on the
 * CacheKeyGenerators associated with each module in the layer that have the
 * same CacheKeyGenerator class name. The cache keys obtained from each of these
 * per-class combined generators are then concatenated to form the cache key for
 * the layer build.
 * <p>
 * If a module builder implementation does not need to generate a cache key
 * because the builder's response data is invariant with regard to the request,
 * then it may provide a null CacheKeyGenerator.

	 * Returns a string that will be used to identify cached responses for the

	 * For clarity's sake, keys should avoid using semi-colons since these are
	 * used as a separator when aggregating the keys from multiple cache key
	 * generators.

	 * key generator.
	 * <p>
	 * For most implementations, these two generators will be identical and a
	 * reference to the current object should be returned. Only implementations
	 * who's cache keys are dependent on module content or other factors
	 * external to the request object need to provide a non-trivial
	 * implementation for this method. An example would be a javascript minifier
	 * which performs has.js feature trimming of code based on the list of
	 * feature names provided in the request. Cache keys for this module might
	 * identify the feature conditionals that the module actually contains,
	 * allowing cached module builds to be reused for requests that specify the
	 * same values for the set of features that are of concern to the module
