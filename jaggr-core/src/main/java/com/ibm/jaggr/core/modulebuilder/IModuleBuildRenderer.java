/**
 * If the object returned by
 * {@link IModuleBuilder#build(String, IResource, HttpServletRequest, List)}
 * implements this interface, then the object's <code>renderBuild</code> method
 * will be called to obtain the build output string which will be included in
 * the layer that is being assembled. Otherwise, the object's
 * <code>toString</code> method is called.
 * <p>
 * For example, The JavaScript module builder uses this method to render module
 * list expansion in require calls after filtering the list using the loaded
 * dependencies for the layer (specified in a request attribute in the request
 * object).
 * <p>
 * Build renderers are called during layer assembly at the time that a module
 * build is inserted into a layer. Build renderers should avoid time-consuming
 * operations such as file I/O, or blocking on other threads. These operations
 * should be done during the module's
 * {@link IModuleBuilder#build(String, IResource, HttpServletRequest, List)}
 * method. When a build renderer is needed, the module builder should construct
 * the build renderer in such a way that all the information needed to render
 * the build (minus information provided in the request) is encapsulated in the
 * build renderer.
 * <p>
 * If the rendered build is dependent upon features specified in the request
 * which may not be accounted for by the build's {@link ICacheKeyGenerator},
 * then the module builder should add the features to
 * <code>dependentFeatures</code> so that they will be included in the
 * construction of the cache key for the layer.
