/**
 * IModule objects are responsible for creating and organizing collections of
 * cached module builds for a given module. Module builds may be request
 * specific, and can provide a cache key generator to be used by the layer
 * manager, which assembles multiple module builds into cached layer builds,
 * to combine the cache keys for individual module builds into a cache key
 * that can be used for all the modules in the layer.
 * <p>
 * Collections of IModule objects and {@link ILayer} objects together constitute
 * the cache metadata encapsulated by an {@link ICache} object. Instances of
 * this object are serialized, through serialization of the containing
 * {@link ICache} object, by the cache manager when it periodically saves a
 * snapshot of the cache metadata to disk. Serialization is actually performed
 * on clones of the objects in the cache in order to avoid performance
 * degradation which would be caused by locking of critical sections during file
 * I/O.
 * <p>
 * Instances of {@code IModule} are created by calling {@link IAggregator#newModule(String, URI)}.
 * <p>
 * IModules objects are cloneable and serializable.
