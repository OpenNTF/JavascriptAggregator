/**
 * This interface is implemented by resource factories which create instances of
 * {@link IResource} objects.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are created by the eclipse extension framework
 * for Aggregator extensions that implement the
 * {@code com.ibm.jaggr.core.resourcefactory} extension point.
 * Aggregator extensions may also register resource factories by calling
 * {@link IExtensionRegistrar#registerExtension(Object, Properties, InitParams, String, String, IAggregatorExtension)}
 * when the extension's
 * {@link IExtensionInitializer#initialize(IAggregator, IAggregatorExtension, IExtensionRegistrar)}
 * method is called (assuming the extension implements the
 * {@link IExtensionInitializer} interface).
 * <p>
 * The extension point defines the {@code scheme} attribute which is used by the
 * aggregator to select the extension implementation based on the scheme of the
 * URI for which the {@code IResource} is being requested. See
 * {@link IAggregator#newResource(URI)} for a description of how the aggregator
 * selects an {@code IResourceFactory} for a URI.

	 * <code>exists() == false</code> and throws an IOException for other
	 * methods that require existence of the resource should be returned.
	 * <p>
	 * This method is free to convert the provided URI as needed so that the URI
	 * returned by {@link IResource#getURI()} for the returned object does not
	 * need to be the same as the provided URI. For example, the factory may
