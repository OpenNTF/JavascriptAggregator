Busy=The server is busy processing the dependencies.  Please try again in a few moments.\r\n\r\nThis message is being displayed by the AMD Aggregation servlet because the servlet is running in development mode and a request was received while the servlet was busy building/validating module dependencies.
# {0} = eye catcher (e.g. aggregator)
# {1} = command
# {2+} = parameters and/or keywords
CommandProvider_0=---Aggregation Service---
CommandProvider_1=\t{0}{1}{2} - shows aggregator help

CommandProvider_8=\t{0}{1}{2} <servlet> - displays the current options and their values for the specified servlet.
CommandProvider_9=\t{0}{1}{2} <servlet> <name> [<value>] - sets the specified option to the specified value or removes the option if value is not specified

# {1} = command name (e.g. list)
CommandProvider_10=Use the "{0} {1}" command to get a list of running servlets.
# {0} = servlet name
CommandProvider_11=Servlet {0} is not running.
# {0} = user entered string
CommandProvider_12=Invalid output target {0}.
# {0} = servlet name
# {1} = file path name
CommandProvider_13=Cache data for servlet {0} output to {1}
# {0} = option name

ConfigModified=The server side AMD config file has been modified.  Reloading the config and validating module dependencies...  Please clear your browser cache and reload the page after a few moments.\r\n\r\nThis message is being displayed by the AMD Aggregation servlet because the servlet is in development mode and the servlet has detected that the server-side AMD config file has been modified since it was last read.

Activator_1=AMD Module Aggregator starting in development mode
Activator_2=AMD Module Aggregator starting in debug mode
AggregatorCommandProvider_1=Unable to create directory {0}
# {0} = Java exception class name
# {1} = Java exception message
ExceptionResponse={0}: {1}.  \r\nSee server log for more details.
# {0} = a module id (file name like string)
# {1} = an OSGi console command string
# {2} = a file directory path name
DepVerificationFailed=Dependency verification failed for module "{0}".  This message is being displayed by the AMD Aggregation servlet because the servlet is running in development mode and the servlet has detected that the dependent modules for the specified module have changed since module dependencies were last built/validated on the server.  Module dependencies are now being revalidated...  Please clear your browser cache and reload the page in a few moments.\r\n\r\nIf this message repeats, then try rebuilding module depenedencies from scratch by issuing the command "{1}" in the server\''s OSGi console, or else delete the contents of the directory "{2}" and restart the server.
# {0} is a filename
CustomOptionsFile=Reading aggregator options from {0}.
